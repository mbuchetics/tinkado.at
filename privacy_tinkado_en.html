					We created this Privacy Policy (version 12.12.2020-111523108), to declare which information we collect, how we use data and which options the users of our website have, according to the guidelines of the&nbsp;<a class="link-style" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679&amp;%3Btid=%20111523108" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a><br>Unfortunately, these subjects sound rather technical due to their nature, but we have put much effort into describing the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.<br><br>Automatic Data Retention<br><br>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and saved, just as it happens on this website.<br>Whenever you visit our website such as you are doing right now, our webserver (computer on which this website is saved/stored) automatically saves data such as<br>* the address (URL) of the accessed website<br>* browser and browser version<br>* the used operating system<br>* the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL)<br>* the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from<br>* date and time<br>in files (webserver-logfiles).<br>Generally, webserver-logfiles stay saved for two weeks and then get deleted automatically.

For Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/.<br><br>TLS encryption with https<br><br>We use https to transfer information on the internet in a tap-proof manner (data protection through technology design&nbsp;<a class="link-style" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN&amp;tid=111523108" target="_blank">Article 25 Section 1 GDPR</a>). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information. You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol, which is situated in your browser&rsquo;s top left corner, as well as by the use of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.<br><br>Google Fonts Privacy Policy<br><br>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).<br>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password. Furthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser. The data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. According to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services. If you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts. Google records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely. We will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.<br><br>What are Google Fonts?<br><br>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a list of over 800 fonts which&nbsp;<a class="link-style" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=111523108" target="_blank">Google</a>&nbsp;LLC provides its users for free.<br>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license. Both are free software licenses.<br><br>Why do we use Google Fonts on our website?<br><br>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server. Google Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high. All Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices. When you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times. Moreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts. Various image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices. These errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites. Due to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts. All common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod). We also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.<br><br>Which data is saved by Google?<br><br>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server. Through this external cue, data gets transferred to Google&rsquo;s servers. Therefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website. The Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts. What is more, API stands for „Application Programming Interface“ and works as a software data intermediary.<br>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected. Using its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are. Google publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics. Moreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts. This data is published in Google Fonts&rsquo; BigQuery database. Enterpreneurs and developers use Google&rsquo;s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.<br>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser&rsquo;s screen resolution and name to Google&rsquo;s servers. It cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.<br><br>How long and where is the data stored?<br><br>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU. This makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet. With the help of a stylesheet, e.g. designs or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.<br>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year. This is because Google&rsquo;s aim is to fundamentally boost websites&rsquo; loading times. With millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter. Sometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.<br><br>How can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?<br><br>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily. Upon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google. In order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google&rsquo;s support at https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&amp;tid=111523108. The only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.<br>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts. Thus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website. You can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=111523108. While Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention. It proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.<br>On https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB you can read more about what data is generally collected by Google and what this data is used for.<br><br>Embedded Social Media elements Privacy Policy<br><br>We have embedded elements from social media services on our website, to display pictures, videos and texts. By visiting pages that present such elements, data is transferred from your browser to the respective social media service, where it is stored. We do not have access to this data. The following links lead to the respective social media services&rsquo; sites, where you can find a declaration on how they handle your data:<br>* Instagram Data Policy: https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875<br>* For YouTube, the Google Privacy Policy applies: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB<br>* Facebook Data Policy: https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy<br>* Twitter Privacy Policy: https://twitter.com/en/privacy<br>* <br>YouTube Privacy Policy<br><br>We have integrated YouTube videos to our website. Therefore, we can show you interesting videos directly on our site. YouTube is a video portal, which has been a subsidiary company of Google LLC since 2006. The video portal is operated by YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA. When you visit a page on our website that contains an embedded YouTube video, your browser automatically connects to the servers of YouTube or Google. Thereby, certain data are transferred (depending on the settings). Google is responsible for YouTube&rsquo;s data processing and therefore Google&rsquo;s data protection applies.<br>In the following we will explain in more detail which data is processed, why we have integrated YouTube videos and how you can manage or clear your data.<br><br>What is YouTube?<br><br>On YouTube, users can watch, rate, comment or upload videos for free. Over the past few years, YouTube has become one of the most important social media channels worldwide. For us to be able to display videos on our website, YouTube provides a code snippet that we have integrated to our website.<br><br>Why do we use YouTube videos on our website?<br><br>YouTube is the video platform with the most visitors and best content. We strive to offer you the best possible user experience on our website, which of course includes interesting videos. With the help of our embedded videos, we can provide you other helpful content in addition to our texts and images. Additionally, embedded videos make it easier for our website to be found on the Google search engine. Moreover, if we place ads via Google Ads, Google only shows these ads to people who are interested in our offers, thanks to the collected data.<br><br>What data is stored by YouTube?<br><br>As soon as you visit one of our pages with an integrated YouTube, YouTube places at least one cookie that stores your IP address and our URL. If you are logged into your YouTube account, by using cookies YouTube can usually associate your interactions on our website with your profile. This includes data such as session duration, bounce rate, approximate location, technical information such as browser type, screen resolution or your Internet provider. Additional data can include contact details, potential ratings, shared content via social media or YouTube videos you added to your favourites.<br>If you are not logged in to a Google or YouTube account, Google stores data with a unique identifier linked to your device, browser or app. Thereby, e.g. your preferred language setting is maintained. However, many interaction data cannot be saved since less cookies are set.<br>In the following list we show you cookies that were placed in the browser during a test. On the one hand, we show cookies that were set without being logged into a YouTube account. On the other hand, we show you what cookies were placed while being logged in. We do not claim for this list to be exhaustive, as user data always depend on how you interact with YouTube.<br><br>Name: YSC Value: b9-CV6ojI5Y111523108-1 Purpose: This cookie registers a unique ID to store statistics of the video that was viewed. Expiry date: after end of session<br><br>Name: PREF Value: f1=50000000 Purpose: This cookie also registers your unique ID.

Your data is distributed across the servers. Therefore, the data can be retrieved quicker and is better protected against manipulation.<br>Google stores collected data for different periods of time. You can delete some data anytime, while other data are automatically deleted after a certain time, and still other data are stored by Google for a long time. Some data (such as elements on “My activity”, photos, documents or products) that are saved in your Google account are stored until you delete them. Moreover, you can delete some data associated with your device, browser, or app, even if you are not signed into a Google Account.<br><br>How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?<br><br>Generally, you can delete data manually in your Google account. Furthermore, in 2019 an automatic deletion of location and activity data was introduced. Depending on what you decide on, it deletes stored information either after 3 or 18 months.<br>Regardless of whether you have a Google account or not, you can set your browser to delete or deactivate cookies placed by Google. These settings vary depending on the browser you use.<br><br>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies, you can set your browser to always notify you when a cookie is about to be set. This will enable you to decide to either allow or permit each individual cookie. Since YouTube is a subsidiary company of Google, Google&rsquo;s privacy statement applies to both.
